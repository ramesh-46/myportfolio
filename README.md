Overview
This portfolio is created using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making the development process efficient and organized. The project aims to highlight my journey as a developer, showcasing my educational background, skills, and significant projects I've worked on.

In addition to React, I incorporated CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and modern design. The use of CSS animations and transitions enhances the user experience, making the navigation seamless and engaging. The portfolio is responsive, ensuring that it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
